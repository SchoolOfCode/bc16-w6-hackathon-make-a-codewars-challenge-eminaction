# Create a Codewars Kata

Idea:

- Create a kata to count how many the vowels in a string
- If the input is not a string return 'No vowels"

- MVP:

  - Always a string value
  - Returns the number of vowels

  - Stretch Goal:
    - Different type of input eg number
    - Returns "invalid input" if input is a number or empty string

- KATA INSTRUCTIONS:
  Simon's favourite letters are vowels. He would love to be able to count how many vowels are in a word or sentence quickly, that's where we need your help! It may be helpful to note Simon finds it easier when all of the characters are lower case!

  Write a function to count the vowels in a given word or sentence and return the number. The input won't always be a string so you will need to consider this in the function

  - Vowels: a, e, i, o, u
  - Input needs to be lower case
  - Return the number of vowels as an integer
  - If the input is a number or empty string return "invalid input"
