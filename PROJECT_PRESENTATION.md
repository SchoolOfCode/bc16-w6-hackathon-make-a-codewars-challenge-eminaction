# Create a Codewars Kata

Idea:

- Create a kata to count how many the vowels in a string
- If the input is not a string return 'No vowels"

- MVP:

  - Always a string value
  - Returns the number of vowels

  - Stretch Goal:
    - Different type of input eg number
    - Returns "No Vowels" if input is a number or empty string

- KATA INSTRUCTIONS:
  Simon's favourite letters are vowels. He would love to be able to count how many vowels are in a word or sentence quickly, that's where we need your help!

  Write a function to count the vowels in a given word or sentence and return the number.

- Input will always be a string
- Vowels: a, e, i, o, u
